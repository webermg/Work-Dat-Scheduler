# Work-Day-Scheduler

This app is a simple work day schedule tracker.  It shows a workday schedule with time blocks in which tasks may be entered.  The time blocks are colored according to the present time, and the page will update the colors regularly if left open.  If a task is entered and then saved, it will be saved to localstorage in the current browser.  The page will maintain appearance across various viewport sizes as well as mobile devices.

Workday start and end times may be modified by changing the "startTime" and "endTime" constants in the js/script.js file.
